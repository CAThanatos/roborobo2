roborobo2
=========

Roborobo! is a fast and simple 2D mobile robot simulator written in C++ loosely based on a khepera/epuck model. It is targeted for fast single and multi-robots simulation (primary motivation is evolutionary robotics et swarm/collective robotics). Its dependencies to external libraries are kept to the minimum (SDL 1.2, SDL_IMAGE 1.2 and BOOST) and the code rely on a simple philosophy: "Keep it simple". It can be compiled with a simple Makefile. And new projects can be introduced quickly and easily. Any new project can be created in a dedicated location in the prj/ directory, without any modifications to the roborobo core.
